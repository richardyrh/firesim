    power is delivered via M.2. or Thunderbolt.

.. |fpga_attach_prereq| replace:: into either an open M.2. slot on your machine or into
    an M.2. to Thunderbolt enclosure (then attach the enclosure to your system via a
    Thunderbolt cable). We have successfully used this enclosure:
    https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Enclosure-Compatible-Thunderbolt-Type-C-M2V01/dp/B08R9DMFFT.
    Before permanently installing your Nitefury into your M.2. slot or enclosure, ensure
    that you have attached the ribbon cable that will be used for JTAG to the underside
    of the board (see step 4 below).

.. |jtag_help| replace:: JTAG. For the Nitefury, this requires attaching the 14-pin JTAG
    adapter included with the board to the board using the included ribbon cable, then
    attaching a USB to JTAG adapter such as the Digilent HS2:
    https://digilent.com/shop/jtag-hs2-programming-cable/.

.. |extra_mcs| replace:: file from step 7.

.. |mcs_info| replace:: Inside, you will find three files; the one we are currently
    interested in will be called ``firesim.mcs``. Note the full path of this
    ``firesim.mcs`` file for the next step.

.. |dip_switch_extra| replace:: power).

.. |nitefury_patch_xdma| replace:: The directory you are now in contains the XDMA kernel
    module. For the Nitefury to work, we will need to make one modification to the
    driver. Find the line containing ``#define XDMA_ENGINE_XFER_MAX_DESC``. Change the
    value on this line from ``0x800`` to ``16``. Then, build and install the driver:

.. |jtag_cable_reminder| replace:: Remember to keep the USB cable for JTAG connected at
    all times when running FireSim simulations (it is used to program the FPGA).
