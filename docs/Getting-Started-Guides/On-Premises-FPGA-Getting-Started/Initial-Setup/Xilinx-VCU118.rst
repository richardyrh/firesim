.. |fpga_name| replace:: Xilinx VCU118

.. _fpga_name: https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vcu118.html

.. |fpga_power_info| replace:: For the VCU118, this is usually ATX 4-pin peripheral power
    (**NOT** PCIe power) from the system's PSU, attached to the FPGA via the "ATX Power
    Supply Adapter Cable" that comes with the VCU118.

.. |tool_type| replace:: Xilinx Vivado

.. |example_var| replace:: ``XILINX_VIVADO``

.. |deploy_manager_code| replace:: ``XilinxVCU118InstanceDeployManager``

.. |fpga_spi_part_number| replace:: ``mt25qu01g-spi-x1_x2_x4_x8``

.. |mcs_info| replace:: Inside, you will find four files; the ones we are currently
    interested in will be called ``firesim.mcs`` and ``firesim_secondary.mcs``. Note the
    full path of the ``firesim.mcs`` and ``firesim_secondary.mcs`` files for the next
    step.

.. |fpga_attach_prereq| replace:: into an open PCIe slot in the machine. Also, ensure
    that the SW16 switches on the board are set to ``0101`` to enable QSPI flashing over
    JTAG (i.e., ``position 1 = 0``, ``position 2 = 1``, ``position 3 = 0``, and
    ``position 4 = 1``. Having the switch set to the side of the position label
    indicates 0.)

.. |jtag_help| replace:: JTAG.

.. |extra_mcs| replace:: file from step 7 and for Configuration file 2, choose the
    ``firesim_secondary.mcs`` file from step 7.

.. |dip_switch_extra| replace:: power). Then, set the SW16 switches on the board to
    ``0001`` to set the board to automatically program the FPGA from the QSPI at boot
    (i.e., ``position 1 = 0``, ``position 2 = 0``, ``position 3 = 0``, and ``position 4
    = 1``. Having the switch set to the side of the position label indicates 0.)

.. |nitefury_patch_xdma| replace:: The directory you are now in contains the XDMA kernel
    module. Now, let's build and install it:

.. |jtag_cable_reminder| replace:: If necessary, you can remove the USB cable for JTAG
    (the FPGA is programmed through PCIe for FireSim simulations on the Xilinx VCU118).
    However, we still recommend leaving the cable attached, since it will allow you to
    re-flash the SPI in case there are issues.
