.. warning::

    ⚠️ **We highly recommend using the XDMA-based U250 flow instead of this Vitis-based
    flow. You can find the XDMA-based flow here:** :ref:`u250-standard-flow`. The
    Vitis-based flow does not support DMA-based FireSim bridges (e.g., TracerV,
    Synthesizable Printfs, etc.), while the XDMA-based flows support all FireSim
    features. If you're unsure, use the XDMA-based U250 flow instead:

Building Your Own Hardware Designs
==================================

This section will guide you through building a |fpga_name| FPGA bitstream to run FireSim
simulations.
