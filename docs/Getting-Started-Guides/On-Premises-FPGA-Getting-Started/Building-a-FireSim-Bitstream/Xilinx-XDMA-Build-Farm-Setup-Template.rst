System Setup
============

Here, we'll do some final one-time setup for your Build Farm Machines so that we can
build bitstreams for FireSim simulations automatically.

**These steps assume that you have already followed the earlier setup steps required to
run simulations.**

As noted earlier, it is highly recommended that you use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as the host
operating system for all machine types in an on-premises setup, as this is the OS
recommended by Xilinx.

Also recall that we make a distinction between the Manager Machine, the Build Farm
Machine(s), and the Run Farm Machine(s). In a simple setup, these can all be a single
machine, in which case you should run the Build Farm Machine setup steps below on your
single machine.

1. Install Vivado for Builds
----------------------------

**Machines:** Build Farm Machines.

Running builds for |fpga_name| in FireSim requires |vivado_with_version|. Other versions
are unlikely to work out-of-the-box.

On each Build Farm machine, do the following:

1. Install |vivado_with_version| from the `Xilinx Downloads Website
   <https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html>`_. By default, Vivado will be
   installed to |vivado_default_install_path|. We recommend keeping this default. If you
   change it to something else, you will need to adjust the path in the rest of the
   setup steps.
2. Add the following to ``~/.bashrc`` so that ``vivado`` is available when ``ssh``-ing
   into the machine:

.. code-block:: bash
    :substitutions:

    source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/|vivado_version_number_only|/settings64.sh

3. |board_package_install|

If you have multiple Build Farm Machines, you should repeat this process for each.

2. Verify Build Farm Machine environment
----------------------------------------

**Machines:** Manager Machine and Run Farm Machines

Finally, let's ensure that |vivado_with_version| is properly sourced in your shell setup
(i.e. ``.bashrc``) so that any shell on your Build Farm Machines can use the
corresponding programs. The environment variables should be visible to any
non-interactive shells that are spawned.

You can check this by running the following on the Manager Machine, replacing
``BUILD_FARM_IP`` with ``localhost`` if your Build Farm machine and Manager machine are
the same machine, or replacing it with the Build Farm machine's IP address if they are
different machines.

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh BUILD_FARM_IP printenv

Ensure that the output of the command shows that the |vivado_with_version| tools are
present in the printed environment variables (i.e., ``PATH`` and ``XILINX_VIVADO``).

If you have multiple Build Farm machines, you should repeat this process for each Build
Farm machine, replacing ``BUILD_FARM_IP`` with a different Build Farm Machine's IP
address.
