Building and Deploying simulation infrastructure to the Run Farm Machines
=========================================================================

The manager automates the process of building and deploying all components necessary to
run your simulation on the Run Farm, including programming FPGAs. To tell the manager to
setup all of our simulation infrastructure, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    firesim infrasetup -a ${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim-staging/sample_config_hwdb.yaml -r ${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim-staging/sample_config_build_recipes.yaml

For a complete run, you should expect output like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    FireSim Manager. Docs: https://docs.fires.im
    Running: infrasetup

    Building FPGA software driver.
    ...
    [localhost] Checking if host instance is up...
    [localhost] Copying FPGA simulation infrastructure for slot: 0.
    [localhost] Clearing all FPGA Slots.
    The full log of this run is:
    .../firesim/deploy/logs/2023-03-06--01-22-46-infrasetup-35ZP4WUOX8KUYBF3.log

Many of these tasks will take several minutes, especially on a clean copy of the repo.
The console output here contains the "user-friendly" version of the output. If you want
to see detailed progress as it happens, ``tail -f`` the latest logfile in
``${FS_DIR}/deploy/logs/``.

At this point, our single Run Farm machine has all the infrastructure necessary to run a
simulation, so let's launch our simulation!

Running the simulation
======================

Finally, let's run our simulation! To do so, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    firesim runworkload -a ${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim-staging/sample_config_hwdb.yaml -r ${CY_DIR}/sims/firesim-staging/sample_config_build_recipes.yaml

This command boots up a simulation and prints out the live status of the simulated nodes
every 10s. When you do this, you will initially see output like:

.. code-block:: bash

    FireSim Manager. Docs: https://docs.fires.im
    Running: runworkload

    Creating the directory: .../firesim/deploy/results-workload/2023-03-06--01-25-34-br-base/
    [localhost] Checking if host instance is up...
    [localhost] Starting FPGA simulation for slot: 0.

If you don't look quickly, you might miss it, since it will get replaced with a live
status page:

.. code-block:: text

This will only exit once all of the simulated nodes have powered off. So, let's let it
run and open another terminal on the manager machine. From there, ``cd`` into your
FireSim directory again and ``source sourceme-manager.sh --skip-ssh-setup``.

Next, let's ``ssh`` into the Run Farm machine. If your Run Farm and Manager Machines are
the same, replace ``RUN_FARM_IP_OR_HOSTNAME`` with ``localhost``, otherwise replace it
with your Run Farm Machine's IP or hostname.

.. code-block:: bash

    source ~/.ssh/AGENT_VARS
    ssh RUN_FARM_IP_OR_HOSTNAME

Next, we can directly attach to the console of the simulated system using ``screen``,
run:

.. code-block:: bash

    screen -r fsim0

Voila! You should now see Linux booting on the simulated system and then be prompted
with a Linux login prompt, like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    [truncated Linux boot output]

    Welcome to Buildroot
    buildroot login:

You can ignore the messages about the network -- that is expected because we are
simulating a design without a NIC.

Now, you can login to the system! The username is ``root`` and there is no password. At
this point, you should be presented with a regular console, where you can type commands
into the simulation and run programs. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    Welcome to Buildroot
    buildroot login: root
    Password:
    # uname -a
    Linux buildroot 4.15.0-rc6-31580-g9c3074b5c2cd #1 SMP Thu May 17 22:28:35 UTC 2018 riscv64 GNU/Linux
    #

At this point, you can run workloads as you'd like. To finish off this guide, let's
power off the simulated system and see what the manager does. To do so, in the console
of the simulated system, run ``poweroff -f``:

.. code-block:: bash

    Welcome to Buildroot
    buildroot login: root
    Password:
    # uname -a
    Linux buildroot 4.15.0-rc6-31580-g9c3074b5c2cd #1 SMP Thu May 17 22:28:35 UTC 2018 riscv64 GNU/Linux
    # poweroff -f

You should see output like the following from the simulation console:

.. code-block:: bash

    # poweroff -f
    [   12.456000] reboot: Power down
    Power off
    time elapsed: 468.8 s, simulation speed = 88.50 MHz
    *** PASSED *** after 41492621244 cycles

    [PASS] FireSim Test
    SEED: 1526690334
    Script done, file is uartlog

    [screen is terminating]

You'll also notice that the manager polling loop exited! You'll see output like this
from the manager:

.. code-block:: text

    FireSim Simulation Exited Successfully. See results in:

If you take a look at the workload output directory given in the manager output (in this
case, ``.../firesim/deploy/results-workload/2018-05-19--00-38-52-br-base/``), you'll see
the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls -la firesim/deploy/results-workload/2018-05-19--00-38-52-br-base/*/*
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 centos centos  797 May 19 00:46 br-base0/memory_stats.csv
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 centos centos  125 May 19 00:46 br-base0/os-release
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 centos centos 7316 May 19 00:46 br-base0/uartlog

What are these files? They are specified to the manager in a configuration file
(``deploy/workloads/br-base-uniform.json``) as files that we want automatically copied
back from the Run Farm Machine into the ``results-workload`` directory on our manager
machine, which is useful for running benchmarks automatically. The
:ref:`deprecated-defining-custom-workloads` section describes this process in detail.

Congratulations on running your first FireSim simulation! At this point, you can
