    ⚠️ **We highly recommend using the XDMA-based U250 flow instead of this Vitis-based
    flow. You can find the XDMA-based flow here:** :ref:`u250-standard-flow`. The
    Vitis-based flow does not support DMA-based FireSim bridges (e.g., TracerV,
    Synthesizable Printfs, etc.), while the XDMA-based flows support all FireSim
    features. If you're unsure, use the XDMA-based U250 flow instead:
    :ref:`u250-standard-flow`

.. warning::

    In some cases, simulation may fail because you might need to update the |fpga_type|
    DRAM offset that is currently hard coded in both the FireSim |runner| driver code
    and platform shim. To verify this, run ``xclbinutil --info --input <YOUR_XCL_BIN>``,
    obtain the ``bank0`` ``MEM_DDR4`` offset. If it differs from the hardcoded
    ``0x40000000`` given in driver code (``u250_dram_expected_offset`` variable in
    :gh-file-ref:`sim/midas/src/main/cc/simif_vitis.cc`) and platform shim
    (``araddr``/``awaddr`` offset in
    :gh-file-ref:`sim/midas/src/main/scala/midas/platform/VitisShim.scala`) replace both
    areas with the new offset given by ``xclbinutil`` and regenerate the bitstream.
